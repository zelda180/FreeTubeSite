# FreeTubeSite

OK, I have decided to start with an old copy of the script that I have. I have ran and tested it on my local Linux box and it runs fine (after much tweaking). The script is in beta and good for testing on a live or local LAMP box. I just have to do a few things then it will be ready to upload here.
