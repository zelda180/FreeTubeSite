# FreeTubeSite

 <B>****THE SCRIPT IS IN ALPHA IT MAY NOT BE FULLY READY FOR A PRODUCTION SERVER, THEREFOR IS FOR TESTING ENVIRONMENTS ONLY. I have ran and tested it on my local Linux box however I feel more testing needs to be done along with some more tweaks BEFORE I feel comfortable with releasing it to an production server. You can use it on your live public server AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AND ALL DEVELOPERS OF THIS SCRIPT ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF THE SCRIPT DOSE NOT PERFORM AS INTENDED.****</B>

Hi Folks!,

 After years of development I have decided to finally upload the FreeTubeSite Video Script to the public. I still have a few things on my todo list to polish the site up and I'll be adding BitCoin as a payment, HD video support, light/dark themes, and much more.... 
 
  I also plan on making a lighter version of this script that dose not requier javascript and other features so that people with poor internet or on mobile devices will have faster loading pages.
